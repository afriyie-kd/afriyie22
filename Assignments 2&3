2. A value or point that deviates significantly from the rest of the data is called an outlier. It can be located at an unusual distance from the least-squares line, other values in a random sample from the population, or other values. Outliers can reveal errors, novelties, or variabilities and offer insights into specific situations. They can also distort statistical measures and data distributions, producing inaccurate conclusions.
3. Percentile Method: This technique uses percentiles to compare each observation to the rest of the data in order to find outliers in a dataset.
Interquartile Range (IQR) Method: A dataset's dispersion is measured using the IQR. An outlier must meet one of the two requirements listed below. A dataset's low outlier is defined as any data point that is smaller than Q1 - 1.5xIQR. This indicates that in order for a data point to be classified as a low outlier, it must fall more than 1.5 times the Interquartile range below the first quartile.
Z-Score Method: The corresponding z-score for a given value expresses that value's distance in terms of the standard deviation1. The standard deviation of the data or the corresponding z-score can be used to identify outliers when the data, or certain features within the dataset, have a normal distribution. Setting the top limit to three standard deviations above the mean (μ + 3σ) and the lower limit to three standard deviations below the mean (μ - 3σ) is one method for detecting outliers. Any data point outside of this range is identified as an anomaly.
